<td>Implemented all the platforms of Maruti BSIII within a very short span of time. This task was undertaken at a very crucial stage when customer had suddenly brought forward the SOP deadline and on top of it the key person responsible for Maruti had left the organization. The challenge was to first understand the product line, understand the customer’s system and expectation and support the customer and our own organization in time of this crisis. With the help of supervisors and support of all the team members, this crisis time was seen through without a single miss of the customer deadline and target.<ul>
